        - Python was the first ever programming language i learnt. <br />
        - I started learning vanilla python on a very old laptop around the age of 11 - recieving various challenges from my dad to complete in the language. <br />
        - I understood the core fundamentals of the language in a week and have been building my experience since. I have made many of my projects in python and still do to this day.<br />

            I made my first ever game in python.<br />
            It was unfinished and unplanned. <br />
            I took a break and did something else.<br />
            Then I moved onto find a better way of making games.
