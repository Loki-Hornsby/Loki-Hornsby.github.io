<hr><h1 id="About_prof">About Me (Professionally)</h1><hr>
<h1 id="About_prof_1">Education Stage: Primary School (Castle Batch Primary School Academy)</h1> <!-- Castle Batch -->
• (1) At first, I could easily understand the logic of Scratch at a very young age.
• (2) Then I began to understand Kodu however I found it to be too simple and preferred creating more complex logic in scratch.
• (3) Lastly, I began using minecraft's javascript command blocks. This got me interested in the fundamentals of programming. I also learnt how to mod minecraft on my PS3.

<h1 id="About_prof_2">Education Stage: Secondary School (Priory Community School)</h1> <!-- Priory -->
• (1) After seeing my dad use an arduino circuit board I took an interest to it myself and decided to try and understand it,  however I quickly lost interest because I found the physical wiring element to be tedious.
• (2) I asked my dad if there was anything else similar to arduino without the wiring aspect and he suggested python. In the first 6 weeks I had understood the language to a large degree.
• (3) I experimented with python for approximately a year and also gained experience with a micro board contained version of it.  Furthermore I gave arduino a try again. I lost interest in both boards but enjoyed programming in python heavily.
• (4) For an english assignment I made my first ever game in python (using pygame) and received an IT award for it.<a class="sup" href="ITAWARD.PNG">[1]</a> This is where I began to take an interest in game development.
• (5) I decided to find if there was a faster solution than pygame and settled on Love2D due to it's use of Lua  just like the console I was experimenting with at the time inside a game called "The Powder Toy".
• (6) I gained experience in Lua quickly and made a demo of snake with beat detection as the core aspect.  I didn't understand the beat detection system I used but I wanted to.
• (7) I then made a mod for the game Noita which I received multiple community awards for.<a class="sup" href="https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Ride-Minecart">[2]</a> Additionally the mod was even featured on a release page.<a class="sup" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/noita/announcements/detail/2905347189777670635">[3]</a>
• (8) I moved onto Unity and started by creating a game with the core feature being the generation of a level using input music. This project underwent 3 iterations and although it was never finished, it taught me generic audio analysis<a class="sup" href="https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Beat-System">[1]</a> and the unity engine. 
• (9) I entered two game jams.
• (10) I started working on a mod engine.

<h1 id="About_prof_3">Education Stage: College (Boomsatsuma)</h1> <!-- Boomsatsuma -->
• (1.) I was given the opportunity to work on the coursework ahead due to my abilities.
• (2.) ... No further info yet because I'm currently at this college! ...

<hr><h1 id="Limitations">Limitations</h1><hr> <!-- Limitations -->
• I have no ability to multitask.
• I dislike working on any form of GUI.
• I dislike HTML and CSS.
• I can't write shaders.

<hr><h1 id="Languages">Known Programming Languages</h1><hr>
Python <!-- Python text -->
• Python was the first programming language i learnt. 
• I started learning Python on a very old laptop around the age of 11. I received various challenges from my dad to complete in the language. 
• I understood the entire language in 6 weeks and have been building my experience since. I have made many projects in python and still do to this day.

• I made my first game in python (Using pygame).
• It was incomplete and poorly optimized. 
• I took a break and worked on a side project.
• Then I moved onto find a better way of making games (Using Love2D).

Lua <!-- Lua text -->
• Lua was the second programming language i learnt.
• I started learning Lua
• Firstly i spent time with a small 2D game named <a href="https://powdertoy.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="link-5">The powder toy</a> - i often played around with its console which was written in lua. 
• Secondly i became familiar with an engine named <a href="https://love2d.org/" class="link-2">Love2D</a> which allowed me to pick up many of the basics of lua. 
• Lastly i made a mod for the game Noita and received <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2293957384" target="_blank" class="link-3">multiple community awards</a>. The mod was featured on a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/noita/announcements/detail/2905347189777670635" class="link-4">release page</a>.

• I made my second game in Lua.
• It was unfinished and unplanned. 
• I took a break and worked on a side project. (<a href="https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Ride-Minecart">A mod for Noita</a>)
• Then I moved onto find a better way of making games (Using Unity).

C# <!-- C# text -->
• C# was the third programming language i learnt.
. After Lua i changed to Unity - i delayed this for some time because i disliked OOP (nowadays i've found i dislike the GUI aspect of OOP more)
• I jumped straight into making a game without any prior learning because i believed this would teach me everything i need to know (i am so glad i did it this way)
• i spent 3 years working on a rythm game - it started 3D, went to 2D and then was remade from the ground up using my own more efficient code.
• Eventually i had a rough idea of what i wanted and lots of code which was all mine! I understood some fairly complex rythm based code which i had made myself and even made my own interpreter to handle map generation
based off of any music!

• I made my third game in C# (Unity). 
• It was unfinished and unplanned. 
• I took a break and did <a href="https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Univeral-Mod-Engine">something else</a>

During my break I had been given the opportunity to make a game with a team in my college (Boomsatsuma) for my course work (In Advance of the task itself). I stopped myself from swapping engines. I Began actually
planning a game and it's features. I'm the team leader. I've ditched my old game but learnt so much from it. I'm the coder and organiser in the team and i'm loving every second of it.

<hr><h1 id="Engines">Known Engines</h1><hr> <!-- Engines -->
• Unity 
• Love2D

<hr><h1 id="WorkEXP">Work Experience</h1><hr> <!-- Work Experience -->
• I worked at <a href="https://sea-salt-fish-and-chips-takeaway.business.site/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral">sea salt fish and chips</a> for a short time

<hr><h1 id="About_pers">About Me (Personally)</h1><hr> <!-- About Me (Personally) -->
Hi! I'm loki alexander button hornsby and I started programming around the age of 11 on an old laptop. My preferred IDE is VSCode.

• <a href="https://dan-ball.jp/en/">dan-ball</a> is most likely what inspired me to become a programmer and go into game development.
<!-- Hobbies / Pass times -->
<hr><h1 id="Hobbies">Hobbies / Pass times</h1><hr>
• Airsoft
• Longboarding
• Programming 
• Video Games (Granted, i need to play some to be a game developer!)
• Hiking
• Cycling
• Guitar (Can't play it yet)
• Reading
• Writing
• Drawing
• Animating (I'm still learning this)
• Basketball (I suck at it :P)

<hr><h1 id="Passion">Origin of passion for work</h1><hr> <!-- Hobbies / Pass times -->
I am incredibly passionate about my work and this originates from my 4 goals. That of which are; 
• never get married, 
• never have kids, 
• never settle down, 
• live in the wilderness (Originally this was "travel the world").

I planned these goals after coming back from a game of airsoft and looking into a bleak office block of workers.
I decided then and there that I didn't want that to be my life forever and I have been planning my life ever since. 

I will work loyally for any company in order to achieve my life goals.

Furthermore, I have a secondary enthusiasm for my work, specifically in the context of game development.
I watched my dad play the entirety of <a href="https://www.dsvolition.com/games/saints-row-iv/">saints row IV</a> and at the end saw a picture of the team smiling.
From this image, I decided that I wanted to build a game with a team. That i wanted to go into game development.
