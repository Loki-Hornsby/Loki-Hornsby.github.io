<h1 id="About_prof">About Me (Professionally)</h1>
<h1 id="">--> Education Stage: Primary School (Castle Batch Primary School Academy)</h1> 
(1) At first, I could easily understand the logic of Scratch at a very young age.
(2) Then I began to understand Kodu however I found it to be too simple and preferred creating more complex logic in scratch.
(2) I began using minecraft's javascript command blocks. This got me interested in the fundamentals. I also learnt how to mod my PS3 to try and implement them in game.

<h1 id="">--> Education Stage: Secondary School (Priory Community School)</h1> 
(1) After seeing my dad use an arduino circuit board I took an interest to it myself and decided to try and understand it, 
however I quickly lost interest because I found the physical wiring element to be tedious.
(2) I asked my dad if there was anything else similar to arduino without the wiring aspect and he suggested python. 
In the first 6 weeks I understood the language to a large degree.
(3) I experimented with python for approximately a year and also gained experience with a micro board contained version of it. 
Furthermore I gave arduino a try again. I lost interest in both boards but enjoyed programming in python heavily.
(4) For an english assignment I made my first ever game in python (using pygame) 
and received an IT award for it.<a class="sup" href="ITAWARD.PNG">[1]</a> This is where I began to take an interest in game development.
(5) I decided to find if there was a faster solution than pygame and settled on Love2D due to it's use of Lua 
just like the console I was experimenting with at the time inside a game called "The Powder Toy".
(6) I gained experience in Lua quickly and made a demo of snake with beat detection as the core aspect. 
I didn't understand the beat system I used but I wanted to.
(7) I then made a mod for the game Noita which
I received multiple community awards for.<a class="sup" href="https://github.com/Loki-Hornsby/Ride-Minecart">[2]</a>
Additionally the mod was even featured on a release page.<a class="sup" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/noita/announcements/detail/2905347189777670635">[3]</a>

<h1 id="About_pers">About Me (Personally)</h1>
Hi! I'm loki alexander button hornsby and I started programming around the age of 11 on an old laptop. My preferred IDE is VSCode.

- <a href="https://dan-ball.jp/en/">dan-ball</a> is most likely what inspired me to become a programmer.

<h1 id="Hobbies">Hobbies / Pass times</h1>
- Airsoft
- Longboarding
- Programming 
- Video Games (Granted, i need to play some to be a game developer!)
- Hiking
- Cycling
- Guitar (Can't play it yet)
- Reading
- Writing
- Drawing
- Animating (I'm still learning this)
- Basketball (I suck at it :P)

<h1 id="Passion">Origin of passion for work</h1>
I am incredibly passionate about my work and this originates from my 4 goals. That of which are; 
- never get married, 
- never have kids, 
- never settle down, 
- live in the wilderness (Originally this was "travel the world").

I planned these goals after coming back from a game of airsoft and looking into a bleak office block of workers.
I decided then and there that I didn't want that to be my life forever and I have been planning my life ever since. 

I will work loyally for any company in order to achieve my life goals.

Furthermore, I have a secondary enthusiasm for my work, specifically in the context of game development.
I watched my dad play the entirety of <a href="https://www.dsvolition.com/games/saints-row-iv/">saints row IV</a> and at the end saw a picture of the team smiling.
From this image, I decided that I wanted to build a game with a team.
